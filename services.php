								<b>Added attention to detail</b> While the addition of tire shine is mainly for visual appeal, an application of spray wax will go a long way in protecting your vehicle. Expect 4 to 8 weeks of protection from environmental damage such as bird dropings and breakdust. Inside, the addition of removing and organizing all personal items allows us to better clean hard-to-reach places. All glass is cleaned to ensure optimum visibility and plastic surfaced are wiped down of more stubborn dirt.

								<b>Make it look like new.</b> Beyond just cleaning everything, detailing the exterior involves the removal of environmental contaminants from deep within the paint, leaving the finish feeling smooth as glass. A hand-applied coating of paint sealant provides up to 6 months protection from the elements.

Steam cleaning the interior not only cleans deeply, it sanitizes, killing upwards of 98% of the bacteria present on any surface with which it comes into contact. The same technology used by bed bug removal technicians, steam is strong enough to kill mould on contact while being safe enough for use on plastics and upholstery. Your car is dry in minutes, unlike carpet shampooing.
